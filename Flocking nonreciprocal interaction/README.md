Non-reciprocity is common in systems that are out of equilibrium, such as active matter and networks of neurons.  In this study, we explore a three-species Vicsek model with non-reciprocal interactions among species A, B, and C. Besides observing alignment and anti-alignment phases, we also observe a chiral phase. The model demonstrates a flocking transition reminiscent of the original Vicsek model.
